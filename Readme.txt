I need to write this readme.
Refer to http://www.skulltag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=24238


Simple Instructions:

	Optional: Open the (GZ/ST)-Models/Build/ Folder. Delete what you do not want. Then go back to the extracted path.
	1: Run one of the Batch (.bat) files
		A: ^ Only if you are using windows
		B: If you are using linux, ' chmod 775 Build-ST-Complete.sh ' then proceed to 2
	2: Wait for the process to finish
	3: Copy the PK3 (.pk3) files into your Skins Folder
	4: ???
	5: Profit

	Note:
		ST-Models.pk3 also requires GZ-Models.pk3 to run.
		If you do not have GZ-Models.pk3, run Build-GZ.pk3

		Alternatively, you can run Build-ST-Complete.bat which will merge both GZ-Models.pk3 and ST-Models.pk3 together.
		You do not need GZ-Models.pk3 and ST-Models.pk3 if you are using ST-Models-Complete.pk3
		This will only be usable with Skulltag only.
